Interested in learning how other end users are implementing OpenTelemetry
in their organizations? Come talk shop with other OpenTelemetry end users!
This is a vendor-neutral space to discuss best practices, ask questions,
and meet other observability-minded folks.

are generated and democratically selected by the group at the start of the
meeting. Topics are rigorously time-boxed by a facilitator.

[Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule)
applies. Meetings will not be recorded.
